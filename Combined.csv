18-30,I’m 23 and I ejaculate too quickly. What can I do?,"Thanks for sharing — this is actually a very common concern among men in their 20s. Premature ejaculation can happen due to stress, anxiety, or increased sensitivity. You can try breathing exercises, using thicker condoms, or trying the 'stop-start' technique during masturbation. If it continues, a doctor can help explore deeper causes — no shame in that!"
18-30,Is it okay to masturbate every day?,"Yes, as long as it’s not interfering with your daily life, relationships, or health, daily masturbation is totally normal. Everyone has a different sex drive, and there’s no fixed 'safe number.' If you ever feel guilt or compulsion around it, talking to a therapist can help you understand why."
18-30,My penis is 5 inches. Is that too small?,"Not at all. The average erect penis size worldwide is about 5 to 5.5 inches. What matters most is confidence, comfort, and communication — not numbers. Also, most partners care more about emotional connection than size."
18-30,I’m 21 and never had sex. Is that a problem?,"No problem at all. Everyone moves at their own pace. What’s important is that you feel ready emotionally and physically when the time comes. Being a virgin doesn’t make you any less of a man — you’re not behind."
18-30,I masturbate to porn a lot. Is that unhealthy?,"Watching porn occasionally is normal, but if you feel it’s affecting your ability to feel aroused without it, or impacting real-life intimacy, it might help to take breaks. You can also explore other ways to stimulate yourself without screens. It’s about balance, not guilt."
18-30,I get hard randomly during the day. Is that normal?,"Totally normal — especially in your teens and twenties. Spontaneous erections happen due to hormones and blood flow, even without arousal. Just adjust your clothes and move on — nothing to be ashamed of."
18-30,There’s a white bump on my penis. Should I be worried?,"Not all bumps are dangerous — it could be a pimple, ingrown hair, or Fordyce spots (which are harmless). But if it hurts, changes, or grows, it’s best to let a doctor look — many clinics offer private visits for these kinds of things."
18-30,I feel anxious before intimacy. How do I calm down?,"Performance anxiety is extremely common. Try breathing slowly, focusing on your partner rather than your performance, and lowering expectations. Intimacy isn’t a test — it’s about connection. If anxiety persists, a sex therapist can help, and it’s a strength to ask."
18-30,How do I know if I have an STI?,"Some STIs show no symptoms at all, so regular testing is the best way to stay safe. If you’ve had unprotected sex or new partners, you can visit a clinic for private, affordable testing. Look for signs like discharge, sores, or burning — but remember: no symptoms ≠ no STI."
18-30,Is it normal to have a curved penis?,"A slight curve is completely normal — most penises aren't perfectly straight. As long as it doesn’t cause pain or make sex difficult, there’s nothing to worry about. If it’s a strong curve with discomfort, a doctor can help check for a condition called Peyronie’s."
